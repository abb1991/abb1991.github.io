    <h1 class="name">Alex Bills - full stack web developer</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Bio</li>
        <p>I recently graduated from Dev Bootcamp, an intensive web development course, and am now looking for opportunities to continue my growth as a developer with a company focused on creating unique and purposeful products that help create a more productive and meaningful experience.</p>
        <p>In addition to the technical aspects of web development, I'm deeply interested in how emerging and maturing technologies will shape what it means to be a 'digital citizen'. To that end, I'm interested in working with a team that puts a strong value on what new technologies should do, rather than just what they can do. Specifically, I hope to focus on aspects of consumer privacy which are present throughout the various phases of development.</p>
